INTRODUCTION
------------
The Bookstore Management System is a program that helps bookstore owners manage their shop. They can check in on their inventory, add more products, add bookstore members, and keep track of sales. The program starts by displaying a menu and giving the user the choice of either starting a purchase, managing inventory, managing member accounts, or exit the program. Concepts used in this project were Arrays, ArrayLists, Classes, Recursion.

With version 3.0, I implemented and used more concepts such as File I/O.


REQUIREMENTS

- JDK
